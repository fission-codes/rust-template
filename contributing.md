# Contributing to {{Project-Name}}

## Where to get help
The main way to get help is on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/uh69TdKfBD).  Though, this guide should help you get started. It may be slightly lengthy, but it designed for those who are new so please don't let length intimidate you.

## Code of Conduct
Please be nice to each other when interacting with others and follow our [code of conduct](<link to code of conduct>).

## How to contribute
In order to contribute you can either add a new issue or you can create a pull request and link it to an existing issue. If the code adds a feature that is not already present in an issue, you can create a new issue for the feature and add the pull request to it.

### Contributing by adding an issue
If you have found a bug and would like to report it or if you have a feature that you feel we should add, then it would be appreciated if you contributed by adding an issue. Before you do so please search the other issues to ensure that you are not attempting to add an issue that has already been created. In order to submit a new issue just hit the issue button and a choice between two templates should appear and just follow along with the template you chose. If you don't know how to fill in all parts of the template just go ahead and skip those parts. You can edit the issue later.

### Contributing through code
In order to contribute through code follow the steps below. Note that you don't need to be the best programmer to contribute. Our discord is open for questions

 1. Pick a feature you would like to add or a bug you would like to fix. 
	 - If you wish to contribute but what you want to fix/add is not already listed in the issues go ahead and add the issue
 2. Create a fork of the repository
	 - A fork creates your own version of the code on your Github, so you can work on it separately from everyone else.
	 - You can learn more about forking [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
 3. Ensure that you have commit signing enabled
	 - This ensures that the code you submit is made by you and not someone else say that they are you
	 - You can learn more about how to setup commit signing [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-commit-signing-in-git/ "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-commit-signing-in-git/")
	 - If you have already made some commits that you wish to put in a pull request without signing them, then you can follow [this guide](https://dev.to/jmarhee/signing-existing-commits-with-gpg-5b58) on how to fix that.
 5. Clone the repository to your your computer.
	 - This puts a copy of your fork of the code on your computer so you can edit it
	 - You can learn more about cloning repositories [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
 6. Build the project
	 - For a detailed look on how to build {{project-name}} look at our [README file](<link to readme>)
 7. Now is the time to start writing the code you wanted
	 - Just fire up your favorite code editor and make the changes that you wanted to make to the repository
	 - Make sure to test your code with `{{test-code-cmd}}`
 8. Please ensure that the code that you made follows our rust coding guide lines
	 - You can find our list of guidelines [here](<link to coding guidelines>)
	 - This is a kindness to the programmers that come after you. The easier your code is to read, the easier it will be for the next person to make modifications.
	 - Your code doesn't need to follow all the guide lines all the time but please do try your best to follow them as close as possible
 9. Commit and Push your code
	 - This sends your code to your repository branch
	 - You can learn more about committing code [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project), and pushing it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository).
 10. The final step is to create pull request to our main branch ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰
	 - A pull request is how you merge the code you just worked so hard on with the code everyone else has access to
	 - Once you have submitted your pull request we will review your code and check to make sure it works. We may leave some feedback and suggest edits. You can make the changes we suggest by simply committing more code to your fork.
	 - You can lean more about pull request [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
